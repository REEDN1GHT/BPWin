****************************************************************

1. Installation
------------------------------------------------------------
Use the autorun setup program on the BPwin 4.0 CD to install the product. The
autorun setup program is automatically executed when you insert the CD in the
drive. You can also execute it by selecting the setup.exe program in the root
folder of the BPwin 4.0 CD.

2. Advisory Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------
*  WARNING: BPwin 2.5 and BPwin 4.0 can exist on the same machine but the
   Bpwinrpt.ini file, which includes custom report definitions, will be shared.
   If you choose to uninstall BPwin 2.5 before you install BPwin 4.0, you will
   delete this file. To preserve any custom report definitions, BEFORE you
   uninstall BPwin 2.5, make a backup copy of the BPwinrpt.ini file, which can
   be found in your Windows directory. After the uninstall, copy the file back to
   the original name. 

*  The first time that you install BPwin 4.0, a backup copy of the existing
   BPwinrpt.ini file is saved in your Windows directory with the name BPwinrpt.sv.
   After the install completes, you can rename the file BPwinrp.ini to preserve
   your latest custom report definitions.

*  Models saved with this version of BPwin cannot be opened with earlier versions
   of BPwin. If you need to use an earlier version of BPwin for some models, we
   recommend that you keep these models in a separate directory.

*  When you create a new model and enter a role group name in the Role Group 
   Dictionary, use the TAB key to move the cursor from the Name cell in the 
   dictionary grid. Do not use the ENTER key. Using the ENTER key will record 
   carriage return characters in the Name cell. To delete carriage return 
   characters in the role group name cell, use your mouse to open the cell 
   and then type a new role group name.

   
*  BPwin 4.0 is not compatible with ModelMart 3.02. BPwin 4.0 will be compatible
   with ModelMart 4.0 (when it is generally available).

*  Using the Import/Export feature in BPwin 4.0, information can be exchanged with
   ERwin 3.5.2. and with ERwin 4.0 (when it is generally available).

*  BPwin 4.0 does not support RPTwin, which was shipped with BPwin 2.5. If you
   continue to use the legacy reports, which are available in BPwin 4.0, you can
   export to RPTwin, if it is installed on the same workstation. For this purpose,
   the RPTwin report layout files (.lwr) may still be used.

*  The BPwin 4.0 tutorial is currently under construction and will be available
   after General Availability.

*  BPwin Online Help. You can read about the new features in BPwin 4.0 by choosing
   What's New on the Help menu.

*  Please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document, which is
   installed with BPwin and has its own icon in the BPwin 4.0 program group.
